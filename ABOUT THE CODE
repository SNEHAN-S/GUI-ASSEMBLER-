    1. Flask Backend
This is our server-side Python code using the Flask framework:

RISCAssembler Class: The core of your application that translates assembly code to machine code

register_map: Maps register names (r0-r15) to their 4-bit binary representations
opcode_map: Maps instruction names (add, sub, etc.) to their 5-bit binary opcodes
tokenize(): Breaks assembly code lines into individual tokens for parsing
parse(): Analyzes tokens and converts them to structured instruction objects
generate_machine_code(): Converts parsed instructions into 30-bit binary machine code
assemble(): Main function that processes assembly code and returns machine code or errors


Flask Routes:

/api/assemble: POST endpoint that receives assembly code and returns machine code
/: Root route that serves the index.html page



This backend processes different instruction types:

Arithmetic/logical operations (add, sub, mul, etc.)
Memory operations (ld, st)
Branch operations (beq, bgt, b, call)
Special operations (ret, nop)

    2. HTML Frontend
This defines the structure and content of your web interface:

Header: Title and description of the RISC Assembler
Main Content: Split into two primary sections:

Editor Container:

Input section for assembly code with textarea
Example code section with load button
Control buttons (Assemble, Clear All)
Output section to display machine code results


Info Panel: A tabbed interface containing:

Instructions tab: Lists supported assembly instructions
Registers tab: Shows register names and their binary values
Opcodes tab: Tables of operation codes




Footer: Basic information about the application

The HTML provides both the interface for users to interact with your assembler and reference information they might need while writing assembly code.
    3. CSS Styling
This provides the visual styling for your application:

Color Variables: Defined at the top to maintain a consistent color scheme
Basic Layout: Sets up the page structure, font choices, and spacing
Editor Styling: Formats the code input and output areas
Buttons: Styles for interactive elements with hover effects
Tabs Interface: CSS for the tabbed information panel
Tables and Lists: Formatting for the reference information
Responsive Design: Media queries to adjust layout on smaller screens

The CSS creates a clean, professional interface with a color scheme based around blue and dark gray tones, making the code areas stand out against the lighter background.
    4. JavaScript
This handles the client-side interactivity:

DOM Element Selection: Gets references to all the interactive elements
Event Listeners: Sets up click handlers for buttons and tabs
assembleCode():

Collects code from the input textarea
Sends it to the backend using fetch API
Processes the response
Updates the UI with machine code or errors


displayOutput(): Shows results or error messages
clearAll(): Resets the input and output areas
loadExample(): Fills the input area with example code
Keyboard Shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter to assemble

The JavaScript connects your user interface to the backend, handling all user interactions and API communication.
How They Work Together

    ---> When a user enters assembly code and clicks "Assemble":

The JavaScript captures the code and sends it to /api/assemble
The Flask backend receives the request and passes it to the RISCAssembler
The assembler processes the code through multiple steps (tokenize, parse, generate machine code)
The results are sent back as JSON
JavaScript updates the page to show the results


The assembler follows this pipeline:

Tokenization: Breaks code into meaningful parts
Parsing: Structures tokens into instruction objects
Code generation: Converts instructions to binary


The user interface makes it easy to:

Write and edit assembly code
Reference instruction formats, register codes, and opcodes
See immediate feedback when code is assembled
Handle errors when they occur
