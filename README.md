    └── index.html

--> THIS WEBSITE WILL ONLY WORKS IN YOUR NEGATIVE COMPUTER (WHY):

 1. Local-only binding:
        By default, Flask's development server binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost),
        which means it only accepts connections from your own computer.
     
  2. No external network exposure: 
        The address 127.0.0.1 is a special loopback address that always refers to the local machine,
        so other devices on your network can't access it
